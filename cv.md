## About me

I'm 14 years old from Russia, who really likes reading dystopia and self-improvement books. It's really hard for me to speak to strangers and I'm kinda awkward. I use calendars to schedule my day to be more productive, and usually I code, learn german via duolingo, run near my house, or try to speak english on discord servers for learning languages (not often successful because I'm too afraid to speak)

I got a bit derailed at age 12. I spent almost all my time on the recently released Valorant. At age 13 I created my first website as a school project, because it was the easiest project I could came up with, but I quickly forgot about web development. So I was still derailed—é

Everything has changed when I read Atlas Shrugged. This book, generally speaking, promotes my core values that I developed while I was interested in politics. Now I want to move from russia more than ever. The problem is that I'm from a small town and my family definitelly can't sponsor me in moving to another country. So I need to earn money somehow. Not the easiest thing to do as underage. That's the main reason why I spend a lot of my time trying to
